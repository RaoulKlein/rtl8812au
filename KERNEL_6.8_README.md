# rtl8812au Driver Updates for Linux Kernel 6.8.0-57-generic

This document outlines the changes made to make the rtl8812au driver compatible with Linux kernel 6.8.0-57-generic for the Netgear AC6100 USB WiFi dongle.

## Compatibility Changes

1. **Added kernel 6.8 specific API handling in disconnect function**:
   - Updated `rtw_cfg80211_indicate_disconnect` to use the new API parameters
   - Added `local_disconnect` parameter to `cfg80211_disconnected` for kernel 6.8+
   - Used `cfg80211_connect_resp` instead of `cfg80211_connect_result` for kernel 6.8+

2. **Verified the existing kernel 6.8 compatibility in Makefile**:
   - Confirmed `CONFIG_KERNEL_6_8=y` is set in the Makefile

3. **Confirmed compatibility layer in header files**:
   - `kernel_compat.h` and `compat_linux.h` already contain necessary code for kernel 6.8+
   - USB handling includes for 6.8+
   - Netlink API and timer handling compatibility for 6.8+

4. **Updated installation script**:
   - Enhanced for better dependency management
   - Added proper error checking
   - Added verification of driver loading

## Installation Instructions

1. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) build-essential
   ```

2. Run the installation script:
   ```bash
   sudo ./install.sh
   ```

3. After installation, verify the WiFi adapter is recognized:
   ```bash
   ip link
   iwconfig
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If the WiFi adapter is not recognized after installation:

1. Check if the driver is loaded:
   ```bash
   lsmod | grep 8812au
   ```

2. Check for any errors in the kernel log:
   ```bash
   dmesg | grep -i 8812
   ```

3. Try reconnecting the USB WiFi dongle

4. Reboot the system to ensure all modules are properly loaded

## Note

This driver was previously working with kernel 6.1.21 and has been updated to work with 6.8.0-57-generic.
